      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="https://lorempixel.com/400/200" alt="abe">

    <p>Abe has had many lives in his 45 years. He's worked in training and development for most of his adult life. He's also worked
    in the real estate and mortgage industries. All positions he's held have incorporated two things: customer service and
    his love for computers. When Abe was in middle school, he begged his parents to buy a computer for him. 
    
    After receiving his first rig, a Tandy 1000-EX and dabbling in BASIC programming, Abe was hooked. He knew that this magical (even if
    not so magical then) box would change his life. And it has. Which brings him full circle to web development.  By the way, don't tease Abe about his first computer. He's very sensitive about it. He wanted a TI-99.
